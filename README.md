## UCLA Master of Applied Statistics (MAS) 

## STATS 418 - Tools in Data Science 


#### Course designer and main instructor: [Szilard Pafka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szilard)


### Course short description: 

Tools for data acquisition, transformation and analysis, data visualization, machine learning and tools for reproducible data analysis, collaboration and model deployment used by data scientists in practice. Advanced R packages, analytical databases, high-performance machine learning libraries, big data tools. 


### Prerequisites: 

404 – Statistical Computing and Programming <br>
405 – Data Management 


### Course objectives: 

Despite the new name and the recent hype, Data Science is hardly new, it has in fact solid foundations in statistics and computing technology that go back several decades.
The *405 – Data Management* course lies down the foundations necessary for most data science tasks (data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and transformation, databases, data visualization and data mining) while the *404 – Statistical Computing and Programming* course prepares students to use R, the most widely used tool for data science.
This proposed course will build on all this knowledge and it will discuss more advanced topics and present more tools (R packages, scalable machine learning libraries, high-performance analytical databases, big data technologies) that are used by data scientists in daily practice.
The course will also discuss software engineering tools/techniques that are important when working on data science projects or when the results of the projects (models, data visualization dashboards etc.) are deployed in production.
While this instructor is a great proponent of a good balance of theory and practice, and furthermore in the context of data science advocates a good balance of statistics and computing technology, this course will try to complement the other existing courses in the MAS program, and therefore it might appear as overly tilted towards software systems.
Therefore, it is important to restate here that good statistical and theoretical foundations (e.g. cognitive science for data visualization or a good understanding of machine learning algorithms etc.) are also crucial when conducting data science in practice. 


### Course syllabus and schedule: 

Week 1: Overview of data science. The elements of a data science project. Overview of tools (R/Python, databases, machine learning libraries, big data tools etc) 

Week 2: Tools for reproducible research/productive data analysis and collaboration (Rmarkdown, Jupyter notebooks, git/Github). 

Week 3: Tools for data visualization: ggplot2, shiny (interactive web applications with R), shiny dashboards 

Week 4: The Unix toolbox for manipulating files/text and automating tasks. Cloud computing for scaling up data science (EC2). Virtualization for quick experimentation and/or for reproducible deployment (vagrant, docker). 

Week 5: Foundations for supervised learning (classification/regression): basic algorithms, overfitting, train and test sets, cross-validation, bias-variance tradeoff, regularization, ROC curve for binary classification (various R packages) 

Week 6: Tools for supervised learning 1 (GLM, Lasso, random forest, gradient boosted machines) (R packages, Vowpal Wabbit, xgboost, H2O)

Week 7: Tools for supervised learning 2 (support vector machines, neural networks, deep learning, ensembles) (R packages, H2O, libraries for deep learning on GPUs) 

Week 8: Tools for unsupervised learning (K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering) (R packages) 

Week 9: Analytical databases (columnar/MPP relational databases), SQL. NoSQL databases (key-value stores, document databases). “Big data” technologies (Hadoop, HDFS, Map-reduce, Hive, Impala, Spark, EMR etc.) 

Week 10: Student project presentations. Course discussions/Q&A session. Summary of the course, conclusions, final thoughts etc.
